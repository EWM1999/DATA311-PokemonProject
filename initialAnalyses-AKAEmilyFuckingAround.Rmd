## Project: Pokemon Dataset

```{r}
pokemon<-read.csv("pokemon_alopez247.csv")
#plot(pokemon)
#plot(pokemon$Name~pokemon$Type_1)
#plot(pokemon$Name~. , data = pokemon, col = "cyan")
#look at all those tasty graphs

```

Let's try fitting a linear model with the response variable total and predictors HP, Attack, and Defense.

```{r}
linmod <- lm(pokemon$Total~pokemon$HP+pokemon$Attack+pokemon$Defense)
summary(linmod)
#plot(linmod)
plot(pokemon$HP+pokemon$Attack+pokemon$Defense, pokemon$Total)
abline(linmod, h = 0.5, col = "blue")
#mmmm tasty sig values
```

```{r}

```
