# Generation 6 has a 100% female rate but no 100% male-> is the only gen here that does that
# isLegendary has moew 100% male than 100% female- one 0.5%

#i think colour is really interesting-> blue, ___?, and red are all higher percentage male while pink has higher percentage female (pink is a more stereotypically feminine color?)
# fairy egg group 1 and 2 also has a higher percentage female
#has mega evolution is higher percentage of being male
#looks like higer percentage male means slightly taller height? (still mostly centered around 1m)
##looks like higer percentage male means heavier?

This block removes all NA values for Pr_Male.
```{r}
#the new dataset poke2 has all na values fr Pr_Male removed
